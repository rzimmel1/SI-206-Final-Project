Calculations for weather data were calculated inside the database to make them easier to pull out when graphing. The code for how they were put into the database and averaged will be placed below.

 Average calc:
# city_averages
    c.execute('''
        CREATE TABLE city_averages (
            city_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
            average_temperature_2m REAL,
            average_relative_humidity_2m REAL,
            average_windspeed_10m REAL,
            average_precipitation REAL,
            FOREIGN KEY (city_id) REFERENCES cities(city_id)

      
      
# calculate and store average weather data 
def store_average_weather():
    conn = sqlite3.connect('weather_data.db')
    c = conn.cursor()
    
    for city in cities:
        city_name = city["name"]
        city_id = get_city_id(city_name)
        
        c.execute('''
            SELECT 
                AVG(temperature_2m),

            FROM hourly_climate 
            WHERE city_id=?
        ''', (city_id,))
        
        averages = c.fetchone()
        
        c.execute('''

            VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
        ''', (city_id, averages[0], averages[1], averages[2], averages[3]))

    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
